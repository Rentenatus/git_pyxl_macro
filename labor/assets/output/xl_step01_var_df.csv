",2,3,{},"## Variable Documentation: `cache`

**Variable Name:** `cache`

**Data Type:** `Object`

**Scope:** (Needs context of the larger code to determine - likely module-level or procedure-level)

**Purpose:** This variable is declared as an `Object` and is intended to hold a reference to a caching mechanism.  

**Detailed Explanation:**

* **Object Type:** Declaring `cache` as `Object` provides flexibility as it can hold a reference to any object. This allows for potential use of various caching implementations (e.g., a Dictionary object, a Collection object, a custom caching class).  The specific object type assigned to `cache` will determine its behavior and functionality.
* **Caching Role:** The variable likely serves to store frequently accessed data, results of calculations, or other information to improve performance by reducing the need to recompute or retrieve this data repeatedly.  This is a common optimization technique.
* **Potential Uses (based on common caching patterns):**
    * **Storing Lookup Data:**  Could hold a collection of data retrieved from a database or external source, allowing for quick lookups.
    * **Memoization:** Might be used to store the results of expensive function calls with specific inputs, allowing the function to return the cached result instead of recomputing it.
    * **Temporary Data Storage:** Could be used to hold data that needs to be accessed by multiple parts of the code without repeatedly passing it as arguments.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Object Type Assignment:** It's crucial to understand *what* object is assigned to `cache` during code execution to fully understand its functionality.  Without knowing the assigned object, it's impossible to determine the specific caching strategy.
* **Cache Invalidation:** The code should include mechanisms to invalidate or refresh the cache when the underlying data changes to ensure data consistency. This variable declaration alone doesn’t reveal how this is handled.
* **Scope and Lifetime:** Knowing the scope (where it's declared) is important.  A module-level `cache` will persist for the lifetime of the module, while a procedure-level `cache` will only exist during the execution of that procedure.

    Set cache = CreateObject(""Scripting.Dictionary"")
End Sub",4,7,{},"## Method Documentation: `InitializeCache`

**Name:** `InitializeCache`

**Description:** This subroutine initializes a dictionary object named `cache`. This dictionary will be used to store data related to German pension calculations, allowing for efficient retrieval and reducing redundant calculations. This caching mechanism is crucial for performance, particularly when dealing with complex pension scenarios and potentially large datasets. The `cache` object will persist for the duration of the macro's execution, enabling data sharing between different parts of the pension calculation logic.

**Parameters:** None

**Return Value:** None.  The subroutine operates by modifying the scope of the current macro by creating a new object.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Creates a Dictionary Object:** The core function of this subroutine is to instantiate a `Scripting.Dictionary` object.  This object is a key-value store, suitable for caching calculated pension values or related data.

2.  **Assigns to `cache` Variable:** The newly created `Scripting.Dictionary` object is assigned to a variable named `cache`. This makes the dictionary accessible throughout the macro for storing and retrieving pension-related data.

**Relationship to Macro:**

This subroutine is a foundational step in the macro's execution. It prepares the necessary data structure (`cache`) for storing intermediate or frequently accessed pension calculation results.  Other subroutines within the macro will likely utilize this `cache` to store and retrieve data, avoiding repeated calculations and improving performance.  

**German Pension Context:**

Within the context of German pension calculations (considering the 3-Schichten-Modell), the `cache` might be used to store:

*   **Berechnete Rentenansprüche:** Calculated pension entitlements for different pension schemes (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung, betriebliche Altersvorsorge, Riester-Rente).
*   **Individuelle Faktoren:** Individual contribution history, insurance periods, and other factors influencing pension calculations.
*   **Gesetzliche Parameter:** Current statutory parameters relevant to pension calculations (e.g., Rentenformel, Erhöhungssätze).
*   **Results of complex lookups:** For example, results from determining the relevant factors based on Geburtsjahr, Versicherungsbeginn, etc.

Caching these values significantly improves the efficiency of a complex pension calculation macro.

End Function",10,27,{},"## `Act_qx` Function Documentation

**Purpose:**

The `Act_qx` function calculates the actuarial mortality probability (qx) for a given age, sex, and mortality table. This probability represents the likelihood of death within the next year. It's a core function for pension calculations, specifically for determining the present value of future benefits and assessing actuarial reserves.  The function utilizes pre-defined mortality tables stored in the ""Tafeln"" worksheet within the Excel workbook.

**Parameters:**

*   **`Alter` (Integer):** The age of the individual for whom the mortality probability is calculated.  This is a mandatory input.
*   **`Sex` (String):** The sex of the individual.  Acceptable values are ""M"" (Male) or ""F"" (Female).  Case-insensitive; the function normalizes to ""F"" for female.  This is a mandatory input.
*   **`Tafel` (String):**  The identifier of the mortality table to use. Currently supported tables are ""DAV1994_T"" and ""DAV2008_T"".  Case-insensitive. This is a mandatory input.
*   **`GebJahr` (Integer, Optional):**  The year of birth. This parameter is currently unused within the function's logic.  It is included for potential future expansion of the function.
*   **`Rentenbeginnalter` (Integer, Optional):** The age at which the pension begins.  This parameter is currently unused within the function's logic. It is included for potential future expansion of the function.
*   **`Schicht` (Integer, Optional):**  Represents the pension ""layer"" (Schicht) according to the German pension system.  Default value is 1.  Currently unused in the function's calculation logic, designed for potential future integration of layer-specific mortality assumptions.

**Return Value:**

*   **`Double`:** The actuarial mortality probability (qx) for the given parameters. Returns `1#` (equivalent to 1) and raises an error if the specified `Tafel` is not recognized.  The returned value is a number between 0 and 1, representing the probability of death.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Worksheet Access:** The function accesses the worksheet named ""Tafeln"" within the active Excel workbook.
2.  **Sex Normalization:** Converts the input `Sex` string to uppercase and sets it to ""F"" if not ""M"", ensuring consistent processing.
3.  **Table Validation & Vector Construction:**  The function uses a `Select Case` statement to validate the `Tafel` parameter. If the `Tafel` is ""DAV1994_T"" or ""DAV2008_T"", it constructs a table vector string (`sTafelvektor`) by concatenating the uppercase `Tafel` identifier with the `Sex` (e.g., ""DAV1994_T_M"" or ""DAV1994_T_F"").
4.  **Mortality Probability Lookup:**  It uses `WorksheetFunction.Match` to find the row number corresponding to the `sTafelvektor` in the range ""v_Tafeln"" on the ""Tafeln"" worksheet. Then, it uses `WorksheetFunction.Index` to retrieve the mortality probability (qx) from the range ""m_Tafeln"" at the corresponding row number (shifted by one to account for the header row) and the column representing the specified `Alter`.
5.  **Error Handling:** If the specified `Tafel` is not recognized (i.e., not ""DAV1994_T"" or ""DAV2008_T""), the function returns `1#` and raises a runtime error (`Error (1)`). This indicates an invalid input and prevents the calculation from proceeding with an unsupported table.

**Relationship to the Macro/Pension Calculations:**

This function is a fundamental building block for more complex pension calculations.  It provides the essential mortality probabilities needed to:

*   **Calculate actuarial reserves:**  The present value of future pension benefits is determined by discounting future payments with a mortality-adjusted discount rate.
*   **Determine life expectancy:** Useful for determining the duration of benefit payments.
*   **Assess risk:** Mortality rates are crucial for assessing the financial risk associated with pension obligations.

The unused `GebJahr`, `Rentenbeginnalter`, and `Schicht` parameters suggest the function is intended to be extended to incorporate more sophisticated mortality modeling in the future, potentially incorporating cohort effects, retirement age adjustments, and layer-specific mortality assumptions aligned with the German three-layer pension system (Das 3-Schichten-Modell der Altersvorsorge).",,,gemma3:27b,134916,,-1

**Name:** `Act_lx`

**Description:** This function calculates the actuarial present value factor (denoted as *lx*) for a given age, sex, and mortality table, within the context of German pension calculations. It's a key component in determining the present value of future pension payments, considering the probability of survival to a given age.  The calculation is based on the life table values provided by the `v_lx` function.

**Parameters:**

*   **`Alter` (Integer):**  The current age for which the actuarial present value factor is calculated. This is a mandatory parameter.
*   **`Sex` (String):**  Indicates the sex of the individual (""m"" for male, ""w"" for female). This parameter is mandatory.
*   **`Tafel` (String):** Specifies the mortality table to be used for calculations.  This should be a valid table identifier (e.g., ""DAV2018"", ""GVG1994""). This parameter is mandatory.
*   **`GebJahr` (Optional Integer):** The year of birth of the individual.  This parameter is optional and impacts the applied mortality table if cohort-specific tables are used. If omitted, the current year is likely used implicitly within the `v_lx` function.
*   **`Rentenbeginnalter` (Optional Integer):** The age at which pension payments are expected to begin. This parameter is optional and influences the calculation within `v_lx` as it defines the starting point of the pension stream.
*   **`Schicht` (Optional Integer, Default = 1):**  Indicates the layer (Schicht) of the German pension system (1, 2, or 3).  This parameter influences the taxation and potentially the mortality assumptions within the `v_lx` function, reflecting differences in the types of pension provisions within each layer.  Defaults to layer 1.  Understanding the 3-Schichten-Modell is crucial here. Layer 1 includes statutory pension insurance, Layer 2 includes company and Riester pensions and Layer 3 includes private provision.

**Return Value:**

*   **Double:** The actuarial present value factor *lx* for the specified age, sex, and mortality table.

**Functionality:**

The `Act_lx` function acts as a wrapper around the `v_lx` function. It calls `v_lx` with the provided parameters to calculate an array of present value factors.  It then returns the element of that array corresponding to the input `Alter`.  Essentially, it isolates the specific present value factor for the given age.

**Relationship to Macro/Pension Calculations:**

This function is a fundamental building block in pension calculations within the German system.  The *lx* factor is used to discount future pension payments back to their present value. It plays a critical role in:

*   **Benefit Adequacy Analysis:**  Determining the present value of future pension benefits to assess if they are sufficient to meet retirement needs.
*   **Solvency Calculations:**  For pension funds and insurance companies, ensuring they have sufficient assets to meet future pension obligations.
*   **Contribution Rate Calculations:**  Determining the appropriate contribution rates needed to fund future pension benefits.
*   **Present Value of Annuities:**  Calculating the present value of a stream of pension payments.



**Important Considerations:**

* The accuracy of the *lx* factor depends heavily on the chosen mortality table (`Tafel`) and its relevance to the insured population.
*  The `Schicht` parameter is vital for correct application of tax laws and assumptions relating to the 3-layer pension model.
* The `v_lx` function (which is not documented here) is the core calculation engine, and its understanding is crucial to understanding this function’s operation.

**Name:** `Act_tx`

**Description:** This function calculates the actuarial present value factor (also known as the 'tx' factor) for a given age, based on actuarial tables and pension scheme layer. It's a core component in calculating pension benefits and present values within the larger pension calculation macro.  The 'tx' factor represents the present value of a €1 benefit paid at a specific age.

**Parameters:**

*   **`Alter` (Integer):** The age for which the `tx` factor is to be calculated. This is the *current* age of the individual. *Required*.
*   **`Sex` (String):** The gender of the individual.  Acceptable values are likely ""M"" (Male) or ""F"" (Female).  This impacts mortality rates and therefore the 'tx' factor. *Required*.
*   **`Tafel` (String):**  The name or identifier of the actuarial table to be used.  Different tables represent different mortality assumptions and economic scenarios. This parameter allows the macro to adapt to changing regulatory requirements and market conditions. *Required*.
*   **`GebJahr` (Optional Integer):** The year of birth.  This parameter might be used in conjunction with the `Tafel` to select a specific generation-based mortality table or cohort effect.  If omitted, a default or a general table is likely used. *Optional*.
*   **`Rentenbeginnalter` (Optional Integer):** The age at which the pension benefit begins to be paid. This is important as the ‘tx’ factor discounts the benefit back to the current age. If omitted, a default retirement age will be used. *Optional*.
*   **`Schicht` (Optional Integer = 1):** Represents the layer of the German pension system (the “Schicht” - layer).  Germany’s pension system is structured in three layers (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung, betriebliche Altersvorsorge, private Vorsorge). This parameter specifies which layer the calculation applies to.  Defaults to layer 1 (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung - statutory pension insurance).  Different layers may utilize different actuarial assumptions and benefit structures.

**Return Value:**

*   **`Double`:** The actuarial present value factor ('tx') for the given `Alter`, `Sex`, `Tafel`, and other parameters.  This value will be between 0 and 1, representing the present value of a future benefit.

**Functionality:**

The function operates as a wrapper around the function `v_tx`. It calls `v_tx` with the provided parameters, and then extracts the specific `tx` value for the provided `Alter` from the array returned by `v_tx`. 

**Relationship to Macro:**

This function is a crucial building block within a larger pension calculation macro.  It provides the fundamental present value factor used to calculate the present value of future pension benefits.  The macro likely uses this function in conjunction with benefit amounts, individual contributions, and other parameters to determine the total pension entitlement or the funding required for a pension plan. The `Schicht` parameter allows the macro to handle calculations for all three layers of the German pension system correctly.

**Method Name:** `v_Mx`

**Purpose:** This function calculates and returns a vector (array) representing the `Mx` values, which are crucial in actuarial calculations related to German pension provisions.  Specifically, `Mx` represents the present value of a lifetime annuity, payable at the *beginning* of each period, given a certain age. This function is a core component of calculating the actuarial present value of pension benefits.

**Parameters:**

*   **`Sex` (String):**  Indicates the sex of the individual.  Possible values are likely ""M"" (Male) or ""F"" (Female). This is essential as mortality rates, and therefore pension values, differ between sexes.
*   **`Tafel` (String):** Specifies the mortality table to be used in the calculation. Different tables (e.g., DAV, GVDB) represent different assumptions about mortality and impact the resulting pension values.
*   **`Zins` (Double):** The interest rate used for discounting future cash flows (pension payments) to their present value.  A higher interest rate leads to a lower present value.
*   **`GebJahr` (Optional Integer):** The year of birth of the individual.  This parameter is optional and influences the specific mortality rates used from the selected mortality table (`Tafel`). If omitted, a default or global setting is likely used.
*   **`Rentenbeginnalter` (Optional Integer):** The age at which pension payments begin.  If omitted, a default or global setting is likely used. This affects the number of periods over which payments are discounted.
*   **`Schicht` (Optional Integer = 1):**  Specifies the *Schicht* (layer) of the German pension system being considered. The 3-Schichten-Modell distinguishes between the statutory pension (1st layer), occupational pension/Riester (2nd layer), and private pension provisions (3rd layer). The value '1' indicates the first layer (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung), while '2' or '3' would indicate calculations for the other layers. This impacts the calculation as different rules apply to each layer.  Defaults to 1.

**Return Value:**

*   **`Variant`:**  An array (vector) of `Double` values representing the `Mx` values for each age. The size of the array is determined by `max_Alter` (presumably a globally defined constant representing the maximum age considered in the calculations).

**Functionality & Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**  An array `vek()` is created to store the `Mx` values. Its size is defined by the `max_Alter` constant.
2.  **`v_Cx` Calculation:** The function calls another function, `v_Cx`, with the input parameters and a value of -1. This `v_Cx` function likely calculates the actuarial present value of a temporary annuity payable at the *end* of each period, providing the building blocks for calculating `Mx`.
3.  **Backward Recursion:**  The code iterates backwards from the `max_Alter` down to 0. For each age `i`, it calculates `vek(i)` by adding `v_Temp_Cx(i)` (the present value of the annuity for age `i`) to the previously calculated `vek(i + 1)` (the cumulative value for the next older age). This effectively accumulates the present value of a life annuity payable at the beginning of each period.
4.  **Rounding:** The calculated `vek(i)` value is rounded to a specific number of decimal places defined by the global constant `rund_Mx` using the `WorksheetFunction.Round` function.
5.  **Return:** The function returns the `vek()` array containing the calculated and rounded `Mx` values.

**Relationship to Macro:**

This function is a fundamental building block in a larger macro designed to perform actuarial calculations for German pension provisions. It is used to determine the present value of lifetime annuity payments, a key component in assessing pension liabilities and benefits within the three-layer pension system (3-Schichten-Modell). The `Mx` values are likely further processed to calculate overall pension entitlements, contribution rates, or funding requirements. The use of the `Schicht` parameter demonstrates the macro's awareness and handling of the differing rules and regulations within each layer of the German pension system.

**Method Name:** `v_Rx`

**Description:** This function calculates and returns a vector (array) representing the accumulated values of `Rx`, which likely corresponds to the present value of a pension stream at each age. It’s a crucial component in pension benefit calculations, specifically in determining the value of future pension payments discounted to the present.  The accumulation is performed backwards from the maximum age, adding the present value of payments at each age to the accumulated value of subsequent ages.

**Parameters:**

*   **`Sex` (String):**  Indicates the gender of the insured individual. This is vital as mortality tables (and therefore pension calculations) differ between genders.
*   **`Tafel` (String):**  Specifies the mortality table (life table, *Tafel* in German) to be used in the calculation. Different tables represent different population demographics and influence the expected lifespan used in present value calculations.
*   **`Zins` (Double):** Represents the discount rate (interest rate) used to calculate the present value of future pension payments.  A higher interest rate will reduce the present value.
*   **`GebJahr` (Optional Integer):** The year of birth of the insured individual. While not directly used within the function itself, it’s passed to the `v_Mx` function, suggesting it influences the selection or adjustment of the mortality table.  If omitted, a default value is presumably used.
*   **`Rentenbeginnalter` (Optional Integer):** The age at which the pension payments begin. This is also passed to `v_Mx`. If omitted, a default value is used.
*   **`Schicht` (Optional Integer = 1):**  Indicates the pension pillar or layer (*Schicht* in German) to which the calculation applies. This ties into the German three-pillar pension system (the *3-Schichten-Modell der Altersvorsorge*). The default value of 1 suggests it defaults to the first pillar (statutory pension insurance, *gesetzliche Rentenversicherung*, or similar).  Different pillars may have different calculation rules or assumptions.

**Return Value:**

*   **`Variant`:** A dynamically sized array (vector) containing the accumulated `Rx` values at each age. The array's size is determined by the `max_Alter` constant, implying that it calculates values up to the maximum considered age.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Initialization:**  Declares a variant array `vek` to store the `Rx` values, and initializes its size to `max_Alter + 1`.
2.  **Dependency: `v_Mx`:** Calls the function `v_Mx` (presumably calculating the present value of pension payments at a *single* age) with the provided parameters.  The result of `v_Mx` (an array of present values) is stored in `v_Temp_Mx`.
3.  **Backward Accumulation:**  Iterates backwards through the age range (from `max_Alter` down to 0).  For each age `i`:
    *   The `Rx` value at age `i` is calculated as the sum of the `Rx` value at the next age (`i + 1`) and the present value of the pension payment at the current age (`v_Temp_Mx(i)`).
    *   The calculated value is rounded to the number of decimal places specified by the constant `rund_Rx`.
4.  **Return Value:** Returns the `vek` array, containing the accumulated `Rx` values.

**Relationship to the Macro:**

This function is likely a core component of a larger pension calculation macro. It calculates the accumulated present value of the pension stream, which is essential for determining the overall pension benefit, funding requirements, or solvency of a pension scheme. The `Schicht` parameter indicates that this function supports calculations for various layers of the German pension system, making it a flexible and reusable component.  The constant `max_Alter` defines the maximum age considered in the calculations, likely representing the maximum lifespan used in the projections.

**Purpose:** This function calculates age based on a given date of birth (`GebDat`) and a reference date (`BerDat`). It supports two calculation methods: the calendar year method and the half-year method. This is crucial for accurate pension calculations in Germany, where age is often a determining factor in benefit eligibility and amount.

**Function Name:** `Act_Altersberechnung` (meaning ""Actual Age Calculation"" in German)

**Parameters:**

*   `GebDat` (Date): The date of birth. This is the starting point for the age calculation.
*   `BerDat` (Date): The reference date. This is the date against which the age is calculated. This could be the current date, the date of a pension application, or another relevant date.
*   `Methode` (String): A string indicating the calculation method to use.
    *   `""K""`:  Calculates age using the calendar year method (whole years).
    *   Any other value: Defaults to the half-year method.

**Return Value:**

*   (Integer):  The calculated age in years.  The result is an integer, representing the completed years of age.

**Functionality & Algorithm:**

1.  **Method Validation & Defaulting:** The function first checks the `Methode` parameter. If it is not equal to `""K""`, it defaults to the half-year method. This ensures that a valid calculation method is always used.

2.  **Date Component Extraction:**  The function extracts the year and month from both the `GebDat` (date of birth) and `BerDat` (reference date) and stores them in integer variables (`J_GD`, `J_BD`, `M_GD`, `M_BD`).

3.  **Age Calculation:**  A `Select Case` statement determines which calculation method to apply:
    *   **Calendar Year Method (""K""):**  The age is calculated as the difference between the years of the reference date and the date of birth (`J_BD - J_GD`).
    *   **Half-Year Method:**  The age is calculated using the formula: `Int(J_BD - J_GD + 1# / 12# * (M_BD - M_GD + 5))`.  This formula accounts for the month difference between the dates, providing a more precise age in years, including fractional years (rounded down to the nearest whole year). The `1# / 12#` ensures correct floating-point division.

4.  **Return Value:** The calculated age (as an integer) is returned.

**Relationship to Pension Calculations (German Context):**

This function is directly relevant to German pension calculations.  Age is a core component in determining:

*   **Eligibility for different pension schemes:** The statutory pension insurance (`gesetzliche Rentenversicherung`) has a standard retirement age, but early retirement is often possible, influenced by age and years of contribution.
*   **Pension amounts:**  Pension benefits are often adjusted based on the age at which a person starts receiving them.
*   **Riester Rente and betriebliche Altersvorsorge:** Age can affect contributions and benefit levels within these supplemental pension schemes.

The choice between the calendar year and half-year methods can impact the precision of these calculations, especially when determining eligibility criteria or benefit entitlements.  The half-year method is often preferred for increased accuracy.

   ' **Zweck:**
   ' Berechnet den Barwert einer Rente, die in 'n' Jahren beginnt, unter Berücksichtigung eines Alters, eines Geschlechts, einer Sterbetafel, eines Zinssatzes, eines Parameters 'k' (zur Anpassung des Barwerts) sowie optional eines Geburtsjahres, eines Rentenbeginnalters und einer Schicht (die vermutlich die Art der Altersvorsorge repräsentiert).

   ' **Parameter:**
   ' * 'Alter' (Integer): Das aktuelle Alter der Person.
   ' * 'n' (Integer): Die Anzahl der Jahre bis zum Beginn der Rente.
   ' * 'Sex' (String): Das Geschlecht der Person (""m"" für männlich, ""w"" für weiblich oder ähnliche Konvention).
   ' * 'Tafel' (String): Der Name der verwendeten Sterbetafel.  Die Sterbetafel enthält Informationen über die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Todes in verschiedenen Altersstufen.
   ' * 'Zins' (Double): Der Zinssatz, der zur Diskontierung zukünftiger Zahlungen verwendet wird.
   ' * 'k' (Integer): Ein Parameter, der zur Anpassung des Barwerts verwendet wird.  Ein Wert größer als 0 deutet auf eine Anpassung hin, die wahrscheinlich auf eine spezielle Berechnungsmethode oder eine bestimmte Regelung der Altersvorsorge zurückzuführen ist.
   ' * 'GebJahr' (Optional Integer): Das Geburtsjahr der Person.  Wird möglicherweise für die Berechnung des Alters benötigt, wenn die Sterbetafel altersabhängig ist.
   ' * 'Rentenbeginnalter' (Optional Integer): Das Alter, in dem die Rente beginnen soll.  Kann zur Validierung oder zur Berechnung der Rentendauer verwendet werden.
   ' * 'Schicht' (Optional Integer = 1):  Ein optionaler Parameter, der die Schicht der Altersvorsorge angibt (siehe das 3-Schichten-Modell der Altersvorsorge in Deutschland).  Der Standardwert ist 1.

   ' **Funktionsweise:**
   ' Die Funktion berechnet den Barwert einer Rente, indem sie zunächst die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Überlebens bis zum Alter 'Alter + n' ('Act_Dx(Alter + n)') durch die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Überlebens bis zum Alter 'Alter' ('Act_Dx(Alter)') dividiert.  Dies ergibt einen Faktor, der die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Überlebens für die Zeitspanne 'n' berücksichtigt.  Dieser Faktor wird dann mit dem Barwert der Rente multipliziert, die im Alter 'Alter + n' beginnt ('Act_ax_k(Alter + n)').

   ' **Rückgabewert:**
   ' * Double: Der Barwert der Rente, die in 'n' Jahren beginnt, unter Berücksichtigung aller Parameter. Wenn 'k' kleiner oder gleich 0 ist, wird 0 zurückgegeben.

   ' **Beziehung zum 3-Schichten-Modell:**
   ' Der optionale Parameter 'Schicht' deutet darauf hin, dass diese Funktion Teil einer umfassenderen Berechnung der Altersvorsorge ist, die das deutsche 3-Schichten-Modell berücksichtigt.  Die verschiedenen Schichten (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung, betriebliche Altersvorsorge, private Vorsorge) können unterschiedliche Berechnungsregeln und Parameter haben, die durch den Wert der Variablen 'Schicht' gesteuert werden.

' -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Purpose:
'   Calculates a factor used in actuarial calculations, specifically related to
'   the present value of a series of payments (an annuity-due or similar).
'   This function computes a term that adjusts for the time value of money
'   and a potential reduction based on an 'Abzugsglied' (deduction term).
'
' Parameters:
'   g (Integer):  The number of periods or years for which the calculation is performed.
'                 Represents the duration of the payment stream or the length of the considered time horizon.
'   Zins (Double): The interest rate per period.  This is a key factor in determining the
'                 present value of future payments.
'   k (Integer):  A parameter influencing the 'Abzugsglied' (deduction term).
'                 Controls the amount of the adjustment applied to the calculated value.
'                 A value of 0 effectively disables the adjustment.
'
' Return Value:
'   (Double): The calculated factor.  This value represents a present value component or
'             a factor used in larger actuarial formulas.  The returned value will be 0 if k is 0.
'
' Logic:
'   1. Calculate 'v': This represents the discount factor, calculated as 1 / (1 + Zins).
'   2. Check if 'k' is greater than 0:
'      - If 'k' > 0:
'         - If 'Zins' > 0:  The main calculation is performed: (1 - v^g) / (1 - v) - Act_Abzugsglied(k, Zins) * (1 - v^g).
'           This calculates a present value component and adjusts it based on the 'Abzugsglied'.
'         - If 'Zins' = 0: The function returns 'g', representing a simplified case with no interest.
'      - If 'k' <= 0: The function returns 0, effectively disabling the calculation and any adjustment.
'
' Relationship to Macro:
'   This function is part of a larger actuarial calculation module ('mBarwerte'). It is likely used as a building block
'   in calculating benefits, premiums, or reserves within a pension or insurance context.  The 'Act_Abzugsglied' function
'   is called to compute a deduction value, contributing to the overall actuarial result.
'
' Notes:
'   - The 'Abzugsglied' likely represents a specific actuarial adjustment, potentially related to mortality or other factors.
'   - The function is designed to handle both cases with and without interest (Zins = 0).

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Detailed Descriptions:** Each constant now has a comprehensive explanation of its purpose within the pension calculation context.  I've focused on *why* these constants are used, not just *what* they are.
* **Contextualized Explanation**: I connected the constants to relevant actuarial concepts (discount factors, accumulation factors, annuities).
* **Data Type Documentation:** Clearly states the data type (Integer) for each constant.
* **Reasonable Values:** I explained the rationale behind the values assigned to constants like `max_Alter`.
* **Module Header:** Added a module-level comment explaining the overall purpose of the module. This is good practice for larger projects.
* **Formatting**: Consistent formatting for readability.
* **German Pension Context Awareness:** I’m assuming this code will be used in the context of German pension calculations, so the explanations subtly reflect that (e.g., understanding the need for precision in financial calculations for retirement planning).
* **Actuarial Terminology:**  Used precise actuarial terminology (e.g., ""discount factor"", ""accumulation factor"") to demonstrate understanding and make the documentation more useful to someone familiar with the field.
* **Completeness:**  Documented *every* variable specified.
